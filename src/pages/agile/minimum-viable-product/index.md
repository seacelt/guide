title: Minimum Viable Product

## Minimum Viable Product
   The idea is to rapidly build a minimum set of features that is enough to deploy the product and test key assumptions about customers’ interactions with the product.  

#### A Minimum Viable Product has three key characteristics:
- It has enough value that people are willing to use it or buy it initially.
- It demonstrates enough future benefit to retain early adopters.
- It provides a feedback loop to guide future development.

Clients can approve three-steps approach:
#### - Prototyping
#### - MVP
#### - Full-scale project

   MVP - is the best one, because it is functional enough. An MVP product has a bare bones design which is then tested on the market to see whether or not it has the potential to succeed.So for the client - decide whenever he want to build a project (and MVP can be used as a basement for that) or decline idea. In addition, it is not so costly and long as full-scale project (normally MVP is limited in 2-3 monthes).

   Those that create and test a minimum viable product can:

* Save time and resources by making sure they are investing in a project which is likely to be successful;
* Check whether the project is appealing to potential users;
* Find out which trend will be optimal for full product development, with the help of integrations;
* Aсquire a potential client base and find the product’s early adopters;
* Save time and money in end product development by not needing to conduct expensive market research;
* Attract investors earlier.
