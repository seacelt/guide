## Business Value

Business Value is the focus of agile delivery. The agile team is charged with evaluating the business value of all work.

Business value describes what the customer will get for a specific piece of work.

This value is discovered through conversations with the customer and analysis of the work involved. Business stakeholders may have data that quantifies the value of a given feature that has been requested. A product owner will use the various sources of information available and devote significant time to understanding, evaluating, and prioritizing the value the customer will receive for a given piece of work. 

Business Value of Information Technology
   Various factors affect the business value impact of Information Technology (IT). The most important factor is the alignment between IT and business processes, organization structure, and strategy. At the highest levels, this alignment is achieved through proper integration of enterprise architecture, business architecture, process design, organization design, and performance metrics.

   At the level of computing and communications infrastructure, the following performance factors constrain and partially determine IT capabilities:

* Usability
* Functionality
* Availability
* Reliability, recoverability
* Performance (throughput, response time, predictability, capacity, etc.)
* Security
* Agility

   The term value-driven design was devised to describe the approach to planning business change (especially systems) based on the incremental improvements to business value - this is seen clearly in agile software development, where the goals of each iteration of product delivery are prioritised on what delivers highest business value drives
