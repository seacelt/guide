## Epics
An epic is a large user story that cannot be delivered as defined within a single iteration or is large enough that it can be split into smaller user stories. Epics usually cover a particular persona and give an overall idea of what is important to the user. An epic can be further broken down into various user stories that show individual tasks that a persona/user would like to perform.

There is no standard form to represent epics. Some teams use the familiar user story formats (As A, I want, So That or In Order To, As A, I want) while other teams represent the epics with a short phrase.

* While the stories that comprise an epic may be completed independently, their business value isnâ€™t realized until the entire epic is complete

Epics allow you to keep track of large, loosely defined ideas in your backlog without the need to overpopulate your backlog with multiple items. You can remember a vague idea with one backlog item until your team identifies the need to deliver the outcome that the epic enables. At that point your team can split the epic into smaller user stories during backlog refinement.

Epics allow you a way to establish a hierarchy for your backlog items where the Epic represents the original idea often closely related to a particular outcome. The user stories associated with that epic represent the various aspects of the solution you need to deliver, or the options you have for satisfying that need.
